		-Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition<br />
		-Windows 7 or higher </p>

<h2>Project Layout:</h2><p>
	Each implementation of an alorithm must be in /[language]/ directory.<br />
	Each algorithm type should be in a seperate file if the language allows seperation of functions into files.<br />
	Each algorithm implementation should be in it's own seperate function, if multiple functions are needed, naming convention is ex. "[algorithm]SubFunName()"
	</p>
