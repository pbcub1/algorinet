Project Layout:
	Each implementation of an alorithm must be in /[language]/ directory.<br />
	Each algorithm type should be in a seperate file if the language allows seperation of functions into files.<br />
	Each algorithm implementation should be in it's own seperate function, if multiple functions are needed, naming convention is ex. "[algorithm]SubFunName()"<br /> <br />
